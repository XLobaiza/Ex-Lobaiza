<h1>Hi! 👋🏼 I'm Exequiel </h1> 
<p>(But the people call me X, like X-box, X-games or </p>
<p>the X-Factor and also it's an Ed Sheeran's album that's called X as well)</p>

<br>
<p>💪🏼 I am currently studying: SwiftUI.
<br>
<br>
<p>✨ I'm a design and user experience lover, that's why I'm always focusing on making usable,</p>
<p>inclusive and accessible developments to everyone. </p>
<br>

<p>🔍 I'm also know about other languages and tools as:</p>

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React 
<br>

<p>🦄 In my free time, besides learning and take all the courses I can📖 . I like to spend some time cooking recipes 👨‍🍳,</p>
<p>playing guitar 🎸, and playing with (one of the best invention of the new technology) my Nintendo Switch 🎮</p>

<h1>Hi! 👋🏼 I'm Exequiel </h1> 
<p>but you can call me "X" – a bit like X-box 🎮, X-games 🏂, or even the catchy Ed Sheeran album 🎶.</p>
