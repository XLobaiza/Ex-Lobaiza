<h1>Hi! 👋🏼 I'm Exequiel </h1> 
<p>but you can call me "X" – a bit like X-box 🎮, X-games 🏂, or even the catchy Ed Sheeran album 🎶.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a seasoned Product Designer with more than 7 years of experience across diverse sectors like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Electric Vehicles ⚡🚗</li>
  <li>Healthcare 🏥</li>
  <li>Insurance 📑</li>
  <li>E-Commerce 🛍️</li>
  <li>Banking 💰</li>
  <li>Scholarship Programs 🎓</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you're in the right place. I bring an uncanny ability to create inclusive, usable, and accessible designs 🎨 tailored to the unique needs of each industry.</p>

<p>Beyond design, if you're in search of a versatile individual well-versed in development and highly proficient in React, you've found the right person. My hands-on experience with React not only enables me to create visually stunning designs but also implement solutions that are both practical and efficient, streamlining the development process.</p>

<p>When the workday winds down, if you're intrigued by a creative mind that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cooks up a storm 👨‍🍳</li>
  <li>Strums a guitar 🎸</li>
  <li>Explores virtual worlds via Nintendo Switch 🕹️</li>
  <li>Relentlessly pursues new learning opportunities 📚</li>
  <li>Then we'll have plenty to talk about.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eager to connect with fellow designers and recruiters, so if you're on the hunt for a dedicated professional with a blend of creativity and technical expertise, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
